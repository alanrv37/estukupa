                    <h2>DJ Estu Kupa by Alan Vargas</h2>
                    <p>The first rendering of the persona DJ Estu Kupa was created through Adobe Photoshop.  The image references the subgenre of EDM called Dubstep.  Estu Kupa has a distinct style referencing games and classic video game samples for creating retro sounding beats and drops in combination with the bass heavy and fast beats-per-minute style of music.  Estu Kupa’s name derives from Bowser, the Koopa King (Koopa = Kupa).</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the image is most successful in the use of color and shape to make the context and suggest depth, as was the goal for this image.  The image could benefit from some more use of lines and with use of texture to make the image be more appealing and dynamic, rather than using only color to create the effects.   The image is strong in the relationship between color combinations to create a persona that is unique but just referencing the idea of Bowser.  The use of text may or may not prove useful in the following image and that will depend on how the focus may change or how different figures may be used.  The silhouette of Bowser may not be as effective in the next image as well and it may be worthwhile to reference realistic images that can still represent the idea of the Koopa King.  This specific color palette will not be repeated and other ideas will be explored for the next image.</p>
