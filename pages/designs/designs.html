                                The above image is the final rendition considering the composition concept of shapes.  The idea for this image is that two contrasting concepts still belong together to create the whole image.  Thematically, it was varied sense of direction and it is the connecting factor between the two concepts.
                                The monochrome of the bottom concept compliments the RGB color scale of the top concept to a create a balanced art piece.
