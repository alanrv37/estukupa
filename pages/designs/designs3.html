                    <h2>DJ Estu Kupa by Alan Vargas Pt. 2</h2>
                    <p>The first rendering of the persona DJ Estu Kupa was created through Adobe Photoshop.  The image references the subgenre of EDM called Dubstep.  Estu Kupa has a distinct style referencing games and classic video game samples for creating retro sounding beats and drops in combination with the bass heavy and fast beats-per-minute style of music.  Estu Kupa’s name derives from Bowser, the Koopa King (Koopa = Kupa).</p>
                    <p>This image appears more successful because of the addition of texture and how the relationships interchange between color and shape/pattern as well as color and value.   This image reads as more harmonious because of the balances between several factors and how they continuously reference one another.  The type feels effective in this image because of how it balanced the other aspects by providing pattern and smooth texture where there was little other pattern present and a much heavier use of texture.  The overall color combination could be enhanced with a third color used for a triadic relationship, to add more highlights or shading where most effective.</p>
