                                Tomb Quest pays homage to the classic text adventure Zork by incooperating elements of fantasy, user choice, and the great big quest.
                                It combines elements of fantasy by giving the players options of different character choices, and thus changing the gameplay everytime a new group is formed.
                            </p>
                            <p>There are several components to understanding the gampeplay, but they are thoroughly explained through different mediums (the instructions in game versus the instruction on the game poster) and you are introdu ced to the epic story right from the start.</p>

                            <p>Similar to Christmas Crisis, I contributed to the narrative of the game. This time around, I had compelte control over where to take the game and had each segmented had led up to the epic final battle against the boss.   Since there was a lot of ground to cover, and take have some variety, there are plenty of instances of story telling based partly on the environment, and then partly on the characters themselves, indicated the the character choice was also an important step in the gameplay.
                            II managed the game poster design, meant to emulate that feel and structure of retro game posters and how they loked and provided specific information about the game.</p>

                                Tomb Quest Board Game, which preceeds Tomb Quest text adventure, are where the originated concepts of the team adventure came from.  The narrative aspect translated mostly into the various phsyical components, especially the cards and the character pieces
                                The key factors of both games are that it is a team based game, and so collectively, all have to contribute to the overall success, or else it is basically impossible to succeed.  The other aspect the choice making, which can be seen from as early on as the first character choices.
